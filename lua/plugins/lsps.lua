--[[ everything to know about lsp >
Language Server Protocol (LSP) support in Neovim enables it to act as a full-featured development environment by providing IDE-like features such as autocompletion, go-to-definition, find references, linting, and code formatting. Here’s an overview of how LSP works with Neovim:
1. What is LSP?

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a standardized protocol created by Microsoft to allow code editors to communicate with language servers. Language servers provide programming language features such as autocompletion, hover information, and diagnostics.
2. How Neovim Integrates with LSP

Neovim has built-in LSP support since version 0.5, meaning you don’t need to install a separate plugin for LSP functionality itself. However, you may want to install additional plugins for a better LSP experience (e.g., for UI improvements).

Here’s a general workflow of how LSP works in Neovim:

    Step 1: You open a file in Neovim.
    Step 2: Neovim communicates with a language server for the file’s programming language (e.g., pyright for Python, tsserver for TypeScript).
    Step 3: The language server provides information such as errors, autocomplete suggestions, and function definitions.
    Step 4: Neovim displays this information as code diagnostics, popups, or autocomplete suggestions.]]

-- [[ Note : ]] --
-- lsps hava built-ing linters & formatters but we can still use external ones throw mason
